## Color

Wagtail marketing assets use a reduced palette (derived from a more comprehensive [colour system used in Wagtail CMS](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/advanced_topics/customisation/admin_templates.html#id3)).

| Indigo     | `#2E1F5E` | primary / primary-100     |
| Teal       | `#007D7E` | secondary / secondary-200 |
